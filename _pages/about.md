<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I'm **Zhang Boran**, an undergraduate student majoring in Software Engineering at **Harbin Engineering University** (expected graduation: 2026).  
My academic interests center around **autonomous driving**, **embodied intelligence**, and **multimodal perception**.

I have hands-on experience in areas such as **mapless trajectory prediction**, **dexterous hand grasping with monocular point clouds**, and **multimodal learning**.  
I actively participate in academic competitions and research-driven engineering projects, and aim to build intelligent systems that understand and act like humans.

Welcome to my homepage! 😊

[**Project**](https://github.com/Ethan-Zheng136/Map-Uncertainty-for-Trajectory-Prediction) 
- This paper addresses the problem of mapless trajectory prediction in autonomous driving by proposing a covariance-based map uncertainty modeling approach, along with a proprioceptive scenario gating mechanism driven by the ego vehicle's kinematic state, which adaptively integrates uncertainty information. The method significantly improves prediction accuracy and robustness across diverse driving scenarios, achieving up to a 23.6% performance gain on the nuScenes dataset compared to existing approaches.
