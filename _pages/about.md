Zhang Boran, I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Harbin Engineering University. I am a passionate "seeker" of computer science and technology. Welcome to my personal homepage to learn about my experiences 😎.

My research interests include computer vision and artificial intelligence models. I have not yet published any papers in top-tier conferences such as CVPR or IEEE.
